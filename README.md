# Games For Ideal Handsome Gamers single-web-app

This is my second project making single-web-app using Reactjs

Demo link available [here](https://gamesforidealhandsomegamers.web.app).

This project was :

- bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- used [RAWG Video Games Database](https://rapidapi.com/accujazz/api/rawg-video-games-database?endpoint=apiendpoint_e4e2766f-1422-4b88-bd10-22acdb7c9a16) from Rapid API as database.
- used [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) as framework ui.
- used [Moment](http://momentjs.com) for timestamp.
- used [React-router](https://reactrouter.com/) as router in react.
- used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as state container in react.
- used [Redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) as redux middleware in react.
